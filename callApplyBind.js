//Call method is used to call a method of an object with another object as an argument.

//this keyword is used to refer to the object that is calling the method.

//apply methhod is used to call a method of an object with another object as an argument. The only difference between call and apply is that call takes arguments separately whereas apply takes arguments as an array.

//Difference between call apply and Bind

//Call and apply are used to call a method of an object with another object as an argument. The only difference between call and apply is that call takes arguments separately whereas apply takes arguments as an array.

//Bind method is used to bind a method to an object. It returns a new function that can be called later.

//Call and apply are used to call a method of an object with another object as an argument. The only difference between call and apply is that call takes arguments separately whereas apply takes arguments as an array.


//invocation

//call immediately invokes the function
//apply immediately invokes the function
//bind does not immediately invoke the function. It returns a new function that can be called later.

//Arguments

//call takes arguments separately
//apply takes arguments as an array
//bind does not take arguments immediately

//execution

//call and apply immediately execute the function
//bind does not immediately execute the function. It returns a new function that can be called later.


//return value

//call and apply return the value of the function
//bind returns a new function that can be called later.
