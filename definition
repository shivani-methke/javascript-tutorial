        Varibales: the containers for storing a value. let const and var

        keywords to declare and initialize a variable: let, const and var

        var: The oldest way to declare a variable. It is not recommended to use var to declare a variable. redaclaration and reassigning is possible in var.

        ES 6 introduced two new ways to declare a variable:
        let: By using let it gives the facility to reassgin a value to a variable.
        
        const:  It means the varibale declared using const cannot be reassigned and redeclared, And it should remain constant throughout the program.
